# Computer-Networks

Runs the Distance Vector Algorithm in Java.

To run:
- Download files: in src folder
- Open terminal
- Navigate to the directory src is in
- Run command: 'make' in terminal
- Run command: java Project
- Will ask you for several inputs
  - Trace Level: 2 (this determines the debugging output, 2 is suffice)
  - Link: 0 (this is not implemented, was a graduate requirement)
  - Random Seed: hit Enter (this will randomly select which nodes starts, nothing as input also works)

Watch as the DVA comes to life!

P.S. The simulator code was given to me, we developed the logic behind updating the nodes.
